# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to examine weather data from Hawaii stored in a SQLite file to determine the viability of a surf shop/ice cream parlor on the island of O'ahu.

## Results
Several analyses can be made from the images below. <br/>

- The minimum temperature in June is 64°F and the minimum temperature in December is 56°F, a difference of 8°F.
- The maximum temperature in June is 85°F and the maximum temperature in December is 83°F. a difference of 2°F
- The mean temperature in June is 74.9°F and the mean temperature in December is 71.0°F a difference of 3.9°F

## Summary
Based on the analysis performed here, the difference in temperature between June, a month in the middle of the summer, and December, a month in the middle of winter, is rather small. Not only is the difference in the temperature small, but the overall temperature is warm, which is to be expected from a tropical island. Based on this information it is likely that a surf shop/ice cream parlor has the potential to succeed as warm weather will attract both surfers as well as customers interested in purchasing ice cream. One additional query would be to analyze the rainfall during those months as rain may dissuade people from going out for ice cream and large storms and/or thunder may dissuade surfers from going out. A second query would be to analyze data on surf swells in the surrounding beach areas as beaches with larger swells on a more consistent basis may see an increase in surfer activity, which would likely be a better location for the shop.
